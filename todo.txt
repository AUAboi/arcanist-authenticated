- Add ability to define dependencies between steps (e.g. changing Step A should invalidate Step B)
- Add generator command for Wizard and Step
- Call action from inside wizard instead of listener. Can grab return value of action this way.
  - Maybe add custom action class to handle success/failure states (?)
- Make route middleware group configurable for each wizard
- Think about way to have "non-persistent" wizards. Something tied to only the current session or something like that?
- Add job to clean up unfinished wizards
  - Make TTL configurable
- Think of way to extend Wizards with custom fields (headings, modals, etc.)
  - maybe a "beforeRender" hook?
