Before Release
==============
[ ] Add generator command for Wizard and Step

 Thoughts
 ========

 - Some sort of auth layer for existing wizards? So I can't just randomly open other people's wizards.
   - Needs to be fairly flexible since it'll be different for every application
   - Could probably be implemented in user-land via middleware

Future Versions
==============

- Think about way to have "non-persistent" wizards. Something tied to only the current session or something like that?
- Think of way to extend Wizards with custom fields (headings, modals, etc.)
  - maybe a "beforeRender" hook?
