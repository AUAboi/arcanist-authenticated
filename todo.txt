Before Release
==============
[ ] Make route middleware group configurable
    - globally in config (`["web"]` is probably a good default)
    - for a single wizard
[ ] Call action from inside wizard instead of listener. Can grab return value of action this way.
    - Maybe add custom action class to handle success/failure states (?)
[ ] Add generator command for Wizard and Step
[ ] Add job to clean up unfinished wizards
    - Make TTL configurable

 Thoughts
 ========

 - Some sort of auth layer for existing wizards? So I can't just randomly open other people's wizards.
   - Needs to be fairly flexible since it'll be different for every application

Future Versions
==============
- Add ability to define dependencies between steps (e.g. changing Step A should invalidate Step B)
- Think about way to have "non-persistent" wizards. Something tied to only the current session or something like that?
- Think of way to extend Wizards with custom fields (headings, modals, etc.)
  - maybe a "beforeRender" hook?
