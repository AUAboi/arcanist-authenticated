Before Release
==============
[ ] Make route middleware group configurable
    - globally in config (`["web"]` is probably a good default)
    - for a single wizard
[ ] Call action from inside wizard instead of listener. Can grab return value of action this way.
    - Maybe add custom action class to handle success/failure states (?)
[ ] Add generator command for Wizard and Step
[ ] Hook up event listeners
[ ] Add job to clean up unfinished wizards
    - Make TTL configurable
[ ] Swap order of arguments in `createWizardRepository` so Marco is happy

 Thoughts
 ========

 - Some sort of auth layer for existing wizards? So I can't just randomly open other people's wizards.
   - Needs to be fairly flexible since it'll be different for every application
 - How to make sure that any resources a wizard has reserved are freed up again? For example if the
   wizard is deleted by the cron job.
   - Maybe `onBeforeDelete` hook or something similar that only gets called when cleaned up by job

Future Versions
==============
- Add ability to define dependencies between steps (e.g. changing Step A should invalidate Step B)
- Think about way to have "non-persistent" wizards. Something tied to only the current session or something like that?
- Think of way to extend Wizards with custom fields (headings, modals, etc.)
  - maybe a "beforeRender" hook?
